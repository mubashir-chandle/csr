    <string name="personality_test_instructions">Each question presents a scenario and you are required to respond with how you feel about that particular situation.\n\nThere are 2 types of question:\nQuestions which require you to simple answer with how much you prefer a given situation and the other which require you to type in your response/opinion for the situation given in the question.\n\nAnswer each question honestly as this information will be used to recommend the appropriate stream to you.\n\nNote: The questions which require you to type in your response need constant internet connection. If you are unable to connect to the internet, you can press skip those questions.</string>
    <string name="view_result_instructions">This screen shows your result for the test.\n\nYou can click on an entry in the aptitude section to see its description or click on a recommended stream to see its description as well as the jobs present in it.\n\nThe streams with a blue line are the ones which are recommended to you. The streams with yellow line are the ones for which you scored high, but not as high as the stream\'s requirements. You might still consider them if you think you like the jobs present in those streams.</string>
    <string name="start">Start</string>
    <string name="no_stream_recommended_msg">Unable to recommend any stream based on the received responses! Please try taking the test again and answering the questions only after giving them more consideration.</string>

Similarly, the more confident you are for a wrong answer, the more negative score you will get. So, answer each question carefully.</string>
